Statistics on football games are often displayed as the number the points each team (home and visitor) scored in each of four quarters. Write a program to create an array for the home team scores and another array for the visiting team scores. The program should ask for the name of the home team and the visiting team. It should also ask for the number of points each team scores per quarter. Then, based on that input, it will create a text chart with the data and the total number of points for each team.

The program should look like this. Remember, anything after a “&gt;” is user input. Also, don’t worry if you can’t get the number to line up nicely in columns.
